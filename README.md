# Automatic License Plate Recognition using YOLO

## Overview

This project addresses the complex challenge of **automatic license plate recognition**, a key component in **intelligent transportation systems** and **automated surveillance**.

The core technology selected for this task is the **You Only Look Once (YOLO)** algorithm â€” a **state-of-the-art, regression-based object detection model**.

## Why YOLO?

Unlike traditional multi-stage detection pipelines, **YOLO** examines the entire image in a **single forward pass**, making it exceptionally **fast** and **efficient**.  
This high-speed processing capability, combined with its **impressive detection accuracy**, makes YOLO the ideal technological foundation for systems that require **real-time performance**.

## Objective

This solution is designed to:

- Efficiently process **live video feeds** or **large batches of images**  
- Instantly detect **bounding boxes** of license plates  
- Proceed with their **identification** in real time
